  abstract = {ABSTRACT: The harbour porpoise <i>Phocoena phocoena</i> is a small marine predator with a high conservation status in Europe and the USA. To protect the species effectively, it is crucial to understand its movement patterns and how the distribution of intensively used foraging areas can be predicted from environmental conditions. Here, we investigated the influence of both static and dynamic environmental conditions on large-scale harbour porpoise movements in the North Sea. We used long-term movement data from 57 individuals tracked during 1999-2017 in a state-space model to estimate the underlying behavioural states, i.e. whether animals used area-restricted or directed movements. Subsequently, we assessed whether the probability of using area-restricted movements was related to environmental conditions using a generalized linear mixed model. Harbour porpoises were more likely to use area-restricted movements in areas with low salinity levels, relatively high chlorophyll <i>a</i> concentrations and low current velocity, and in areas with steep bottom slopes, suggesting that such areas are important foraging grounds for porpoises. Our study identifies environmental parameters of relevance for predicting harbour porpoise foraging hot spots over space and time in a dynamic system. The study illustrates how movement patterns and data on environmental conditions can be combined, which is valuable to the conservation of marine mammals.},

  abstract = {Animals often alternate between searching for food locally and moving over larger distances depending on the amount of food they find. This ability to switch between movement modes can have large implications on the fate of individuals and populations, and a mechanism that allows animals to find the optimal balance between alternative movement strategies is therefore selectively advantageous. Recent theory suggests that animals are capable of switching movement mode depending on heterogeneities in the landscape, and that different modes may predominate at different temporal scales. Here we develop a conceptual model that enables animals to use either an area-concentrated food search behavior or undirected random movements. The model builds on the animals’ ability to remember the profitability and location of previously visited areas. In contrast to classical optimal foraging models, our model does not assume food to be distributed in large, well-defined patches, and our focus is on animal movement rather than on how animals choose between foraging patches with known locations and value. After parameterizing the fine-scale movements to resemble those of the harbor porpoise Phocoena phocoena we investigate whether the model is capable of producing emergent home ranges and use pattern-oriented modeling to evaluate whether it can reproduce the large-scale movement patterns observed for porpoises in nature. Finally we investigate whether the model enables animals to forage optimally. We found that the model was indeed able to produce either stable home ranges or movement patterns that resembled those of real porpoises. It enabled animals to maximize their food intake when fine-tuning the memory parameters that controlled the relative contribution of area concentrated and random movements.},

  abstract = {Abstract The population status of harbor porpoises has been of concern for several years, and the establishment of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) has been suggested as a method to protect the harbor porpoise (Phocoena phocoena, Linneaus 1758) and other small cetaceans. In order to designate MPAs, high-density areas for the species must be identified. Spatial distribution of small cetaceans is usually assessed from ship or aerial surveys. As a potentially more accurate alternative, this study examined the movements and area preferences of 64 harbor porpoises, satellite tagged between 1997 and 2007, in order to determine the distribution in the North Sea, the western Baltic, and the waters in between. Results show that harbor porpoises are not evenly distributed, but congregate in nine high-density areas within the study area. Several of these areas are subject to significant seasonal variation. The study found no differences in the home range size of males and females, but immature harbor porpoises have larger home ranges than mature porpoises. The use of satellite telemetry for identifying areas of high harbor porpoise density can be of key importance when designating MPAs.},

  abstract      = {The movements of nine harbour porpoises, Phocoena phocoena (L.), in the Bay of Fundy and Gulf of Maine were tracked using satellite telemetry. Transmitters were attached to the porpoises in August 1994 and 1995 after they were captured near Grand Manan Island at the mouth of the Bay of Fundy. Tracking periods ranged from 2 to 212 d (mean 50 ± 65 d). Porpoises exhibited a high degree of individual variation in movement patterns; five moved out of the Bay of Fundy into the Gulf of Maine. The porpoise with the longest tracking period moved extensively throughout the Gulf of Maine. These data suggest that seasonal movement patterns of individual harbour porpoises are discrete and are not temporally coordinated migrations. Porpoises that moved out of the Bay of Fundy into the Gulf of Maine did so following the 92 m isobath, which may represent an important movement corridor. The movement of porpoises from the Bay of Fundy into the Gulf of Maine supports the hypothesis that harbour porpoises from these two regions comprise a single population at risk of entanglement in both Canadian and US fisheries.},

  abstract = {Determining the movement of marine animals is logistically difficult and is currently primarily based on VHF and satellite-tracking telemetry, GPS, acoustic telemetry, and geolocation, all of which have substantial limitations in accurately locating the fine-scale movements of these animals. A recent development—that of dead-reckoning—is being increasingly used to examine the fine-scale movement of animals underwater. The advantages and drawbacks of this approach are quite different to those incurred by the other methods. This paper considers the advances that dead-reckoning can bring to the study of the often cryptic movement and behaviour of marine animals at sea. Methods used in determining position via dead-reckoning are presented and consideration is given to results derived from the use of dead-reckoning on cetaceans, pinnipeds, penguins and sea turtles; these are complemented by data on cormorants and albatrosses acquired using GPS systems. Suggestions are made as to how movement data derived from these devices can be analysed using indices that allow interpretation over a large variety of temporal and spatial scales.},
